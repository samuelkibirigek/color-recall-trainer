# Color Recall Trainer

A high-performance web application designed to help users master 3-digit color code associations through scaffolded learning. This tool bridges the gap between recognition and active retrieval, making it ideal for professionals in manufacturing, design, or logistics.

## 1. Methodology
The trainer follows a two-stage progression to ensure long-term data retention:

* **Stage 1: Recognition (Score 0-50)**
    Users identify the correct 3-digit code from multiple-choice options. This phase builds the initial mental bridge between the visual color and its numerical identifier.
* **Stage 2: Recall (Score 50+)**
    The "safety net" is removed. Users must manually enter the 3-digit code using a numeric keypad. This forces active retrieval, the most effective method for moving data into long-term memory.

## 2. Core Features
* **Immediate Feedback:** Correct answers flash **Green**, while errors flash **Red**.
* **Guided Correction:** In Stage 1, incorrect guesses trigger a faint green highlight on the correct button to facilitate passive learning.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Optimized for seamless use on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
* **PWA Ready:** Includes a `manifest.json` for "Add to Home Screen" installation on iOS and Android.

## 3. Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Mobile-first design)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Deployment:** Optimized for GitHub Pages
